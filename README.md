Virtual_CPU_Emulator

Overview

The Virtual CPU Emulator project is designed to simulate essential CPU components and operations, providing a foundational understanding of CPU architecture and behavior. The emulator will cover key elements such as the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory management, and I/O operations. This project follows a structured 10-week plan to ensure systematic development and testing.

Project Goals
Develop Core CPU Functionalities: Create a virtual CPU that can execute basic operations similar to a physical CPU. 

Implement Basic Instructions: Support fundamental instructions like ADD, SUB, LOAD, and STORE to mimic essential computational and memory operations.

Create a Testing Environment: Design an environment for running and testing simple assembly programs on the emulator to validate functionality and performance.

Features

Registers: Implement key CPU registers, such as the Program Counter (PC), Accumulator (ACC), and general-purpose registers (e.g., R0, R1).

Memory Management: Allocate memory space for data and instruction storage, simulating CPU memory interaction.

Instruction Set: Develop a minimal set of CPU instructions for arithmetic, logical, data movement, and control flow.

Execution Cycle: Implement the CPU's Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle to process each instruction.

Stack Support: Add a basic stack for function calls and nested operations.

Error Handling: Integrate mechanisms to catch and report issues like invalid instructions and memory overflows.

I/O Operations: Include basic I/O instructions to simulate fundamental input/output interactions.

Collaboration and Workflow
Version Control: We use GitHub to track changes, manage version control, and facilitate collaboration among team members.

Branching Strategy: Each team member works on individual branches for specific tasks (e.g., ISA development, ALU implementation), which are reviewed and merged into the main branch.

Pull Requests and Code Review: Code changes are submitted through pull requests for team review before merging, ensuring quality and alignment with project objectives.
